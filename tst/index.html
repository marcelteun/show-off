  Below you can check some prepared OFF-files that are located on the web
  server. It is also possible to load <a href="local_off.html">local</a> off-files.

  It is also possible to display symmetric object by reusing a base shape
  multiple times and transforming the base shape interactively.
  Here is <a href="orbit_shape.html">an example</a>.</p>

  <h2>Navigation by Mouse and Keyboard</h2>
  <p>
  Left click a mouse and move it to rotate the object, normally in an intuitive
  way: it is as if you touch a ball an spin it. This way isn't implemented all
  the way through though, since I also wanted that if you return to your
  starting point and release the object should have its original orientation.
  It is also possible to rotate the object around an axis that sticks out of the
  canvas. This can be done by clicking and dragging along the edges of the
  canvas.
  </p><p>
  Because I also wanted the object to get back to its initial position
  when releasing it at the same spot, some strange effects can be seen when
  taking up the object in the centre of the canvas (by clicking) move it to a
  side, rotate it 180 degrees around an axis orthogonal to the canvas and then
  drag it back to the centre of the canvas.
  </p><p>
  Zooming can be done by pressing the shift and using the main mouse-click.
  Other actions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Undo zoom and rotate (original position): '5'.
    </li><li>
      Undo zoom only: shift-5.
    </li><li>
      Undo rotate only: alt-5.
    </li><li>
      The mouse wheel works for zooming as well, but the speed might be low.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  By default concave polygons are supported by means of a stencil buffer. This
  means that two passes are required and all faces need to be considered
  separately.  This isn't very efficient, so there is a way to optimise this for
  objects that only have convex faces: The key 'c' is used to toggle support for
  concave and convex faces.
  </p>
  <h2>Navigation by Touch Screen</h2>
  <p>
  The following actions are support for touch screen:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Rotate: single touch and drag. The rotation axis is defined in the same
      way as for the mouse. See previous section.
    </li><li>
      Zoom in: double touch and increase distance between the two fingers.
    </li><li>
      Zoom out: double touch and decrease distance between the two fingers.
    </li><li>
      Jump back to original orientation: triple touch.
    </li>
  </ul>
